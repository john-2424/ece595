This paper presents a critical review of three influential works published in CVPR between 2022 and 2025, each representing a distinct direction in modern computer vision research. The selected papers cover advances in convolutional network design (ConvNeXt, CVPR 2022), integrated end-to-end perception and planning for autonomous driving (UniAD, CVPR 2023), and reasoning-driven visual navigation through a dynamical‑systems perspective (CVPR 2025). While these works span different tasks and subfields, they collectively highlight the rapid methodological evolution of computer vision over the past three years.  

The paper provides a structured critique of each work, analyzing their motivations, architectural choices, empirical validation, and limitations. Additionally, it outlines an implementation plan for adopting one of the studied methods as part of future coursework, detailing the essential components required for a non‑trivial and faithful reproduction. This consolidated review aims to deepen understanding of current trends in vision models and position future implementation work in a broader research context.
